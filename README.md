## Who is me?

I code for fun and love it. I find it relaxing, isn't it? At the time of this writing I have only a couple months of programming experience. I qualify myself a self taught hobbyist in this field of expertise... In order of preference, I am actively learning with: trials and error; online reference documentation sites; reading books and some online educational resources. I am not a professional programmer or developper and I have very limited knowledge in programming. For me, this project is a useful way to explore Github functionalities, responsive HTML forms, JS, PHP and the L18N process (localisation) all at once. On my day job, I lead people and solve problems in a big corporation...
